# Why?

Lots of people mistake my name to be Zach "Dobson" instead of Zach "Dodson". So as a joke I made a basic site in PHP
for anyone who makes that mistake. Plus I get to try out PHP.

This site is its own thing and does not directly connect to the rest of the `retro-desktop-portfolio` website. This is merely
a place to play around with PHP. The plan is to have it hosted somewhere under its own domain (probably `zachdodson.me`). This
document will be updated when something is actually done with this.

## Commands

```bash
# Start PHP Server (from root)
php -S localhost:3000

# Can also use the following from root:
npm run php
```
