      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        C mathematics library with a WebAssembly compilation target,
        but can also be used as a C library with the provided header file.
        This is the library used for the Calculator program on this web application (accessible from start menu /
        clicking the "Open Calculator" link above).

      <h2>Why C and WebAssembly?</h2>

      <p>
        This project was originally intended for use just in my personal website as a project to improve my math skills.
        Because the calculator logic itself does not need a front-end for input,
        I decided to use C with a WebAssembly compilation target instead of Angular / TypeScript to keep the front-end
        logic separate from the back-end, while also learning about the C programming language and WebAssembly.
        When the library was capable of performing all calculations required for the "Standard" calculator mode,
        I decided to open source the project and move it into its own repository so others could use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Note: </b> the library is not in a complete state. I wish to complete it soon to improve precision of some functions as
        well as adding support for various scientific calculator functions and modes. However, this project is not a priority to me
        over other projects. I will likely try to complete the library during 2026.
