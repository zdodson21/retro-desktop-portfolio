                <p>I've always liked the UI, aesthetics, and feel of Windows 95. As for creating a whole web application around it, I thought it would challenge me to create something using numerous "new-to-me" technologies (such as Angular, SCSS, TypeScript, etc.), and building around a design I already liked certainly helped the process.</p>

                <p>While this web app originally started as a way to display my portfolio, I decided to also make it my sandbox for learning new technologies. This includes tech integrated directly into the application, as well as learning several external tools such as Docker for containerization and Electron for bundling this web application as a usable desktop application.</p>

                <p>I intend to update this site periodically with new projects (both interactive and text descriptions). Mainly just whenever I feel like making something new. I currently have plans to recreate a few programs (such as Calculator and Paint), since they can teach me quite a bit for front-end and back-end development. They will be developed in branches (viewable on GitHub) and merged into the main branch when completed.</p>
