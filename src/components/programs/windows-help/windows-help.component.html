                  All of that information can be viewed by navigating to the Internet Explorer program!
                  The easiest way to do that is by clicking the Start button,
                  then clicking the Internet Explorer program in the Start Menu.

                <p>
                  I can't clearly remember if I have ever used a computer with Windows 95 on it, but I always liked
                  the user-interface of it and thought there was some charm to it.
                  As for creating a whole web application around it, I thought it would challenge me to create something
                  using numerous "new-to-me" technologies (such as Angular, SCSS, TypeScript, etc.),
                  and building around a design I already liked certainly helped the process.

              @case (3) { <!-- How do I navigate? -->
                <p>
                  There are multiple ways to navigate this web app! You can open programs from the "Desktop", locate them in
                  the Start Menu, open ".html" files in Internet Explorer from Windows Explorer, and perhaps more in the future!
                </p>
              }
              @case (4) { <!-- Why use Docker, Electron, WebAssembly (maybe?), other extra tech? -->
                <p>
                  While this web app originally started as a way to display my portfolio, I decided to also make it
                  my sandbox for learning new technologies. This includes tech integrated directly into the application,
                  as well as learning several external tools such as Docker for containerization and Electron for bundling
                  this web application as a usable desktop application.
                </p>
              }
              @case (5) { <!-- Updates? -->
                <p>
                  I intend to, but nothing steady. Mainly just whenever I feel like making something new.
                  I currently have plans to recreate a few programs (such as Calculator and Paint),
                  which I will release as they are completed.
