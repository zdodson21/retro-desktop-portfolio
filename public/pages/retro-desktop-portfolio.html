    <h1>Retro-Desktop Portfolio Web Application</h1>
    <article>
      <div class="purpose">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>I wanted to create a portfolio website from scratch without relying on the limitations that come with any content management system (CMS). This allows me to create something of my own that I understand the inner workings of, enabling me to customize it in any way I wish.</p>
        <p>I decided to utilize the retro "Windows" theme because I could adapt many design and functional aspects of an operating system to this web application. This includes a few things such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating individual projects within my portfolio site such as the "System Informaton" program or "Notepad". These programs are written in either JavaScript or TypeScript with the Angular Framework or Lit Library depending on the need for what I call "system level" access</li>
          <li>Creating a "web-browser" like application to display various "websites" (HTML files) in iFrames, which gives the feel of actually using Internet Explorer from older versions of Windows.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately this web application serves as a place to show off both written descriptions of my projects as well as functional versions of projects themselves.</p>
